# Euler

Individual problems are found in `lib/`.

Each problem is in a module with a public `solve()` function, with a doctest against the solution. Run each problem from here with `mix run ./bin/<filename>`.

Lots of these can probably be further optimised. This was mostly to learn elixir, so that's fine.
